### Wei Wang 王伟
I am currently a thrid-year PhD student in Multimedia and Human Understanding Group [MHUG](http://mhug.disi.unitn.it/index.php/people/) at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Univeristy of Trento, Italy, directed by [Nicu Sebe](http://disi.unitn.it/~sebe/). My research area is deep learning and its applications in computer vision and multimedia.

### Research
I am interested in face analysis (face landmark localization, face aging, expression analysis) and human action understanding (multiview action recongnition).
